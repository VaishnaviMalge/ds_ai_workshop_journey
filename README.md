# ds_ai_workshop_journey

    This repository contains my work files, notebooks and notes about Data Science, AI, GenAI, and new emerging technologies. 
    This practice files are inspired by workshops and self study. I will be learning new concepts and technologies, and keep 
    growing.
    As I learn new concepts, will experiment with new ideas and will continue updating this repository.
